  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>My name is Filipe Fernandes and I'm dad, husband, front-end developer & founder at <a href="http://chocoladesign.com" target="_blank">Choco la Design</a>. I started working as a designer in 2003 and as front-end in 2005.</p>

    <p>I provided consultancy to government agencies in Brazil like the Ministry of Health and Supreme Court about front-end architecture and UI design.</p>

    <p>In 2010 I founded Choco la Design. It's a website where me and my contributors talk about design, helping our readers understand more about theory, technique and the market itself sharing our experiences.</p>
