    <p>My name is Filipe Fernandes and am a dad, husband, front-end developer & founder at <a href="http://chocoladesign.com" target="_blank">Choco la Design</a>. I started working with design and development in 2005.</p>

    <p>In 2010 I founded Choco la Design. It's a website where my contributors and I talk about design, helping our readers understand more about theory, technique and the market itself sharing our experiences.</p>
