    <p>I spend the last 11 years building websites for small and medium companies with Wordpress focused in SEO. In the middle of this journey, I founded <a href="http://chocoladesign.com" title="Choco la Design" target="_blank">Choco la Design</a> which have 100k unique visitors/month. It's a collaborative blog about design, where me and my contributors helping people with our market knowledge and experience.</p>
    <p>Since 2014 I've focused my research to build web applications which have a better performance, writing a manageable and scalable front-end. This is what I want to keep doing. This is how I believe I can help the web be a better place for the most important client I have in the world: people.</p>
    <p>During all this journey, I've increased my skills with technical stuff like HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Jade, even in Ruby.</p>
    <p>Keep studying everyday make me learn more about methodologies and frameworks like <a href="http://oocss.org" title="Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OOCSS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" title="Software design pattern" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">design patterns</a>, <a href="https://en.bem.info/method/" title="BEM MEthodology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEM</a>, <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/" title="Atomic Design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Design</a>, <a href="http://smacss.com" title="Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SMACSS</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4" title="Inverted Triangle architecture for CSS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ITCSS</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org" title="AngularJS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" title="Ruby on Rails" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" title="Zurb Foundation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zurb Foundation</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" title="Twitter Bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>
    <p>But keep all those things do a lot of work, so I had to learn more about workflow, how to automate taks with <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Automate and enhance your workflow with Gulp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gulp</a>, managing dependecies with <a href="http://bower.io/" title="A package manager for the web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bower</a>, generate boilerplates with <a href="http://yeoman.io/" title="The Web's Scaffolding Tool For Modern Webapps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yeoman</a> and with all this I make three good friends: Command line, Git and Chrome Dev Tools.</p>
    <p>Last but not least, I'm always learning about personal branding, leadership, entrepreneurship and team management.</p>
    <p><a href="http://instagram.com/p/forEYuO9z9/" title="When I became a dad." target="_blank">Being a dad</a> made me a better professional than I was. This is the reason I get out of bed every morning and think that everything can be possible. This caused me to become more creative in the most critical situations and find different solutions to a single problem. Benjamin is the reason I believe in simplicity.</p>
