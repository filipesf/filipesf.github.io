    <p class="about__content">I spend the last 11 years building websites for small and medium companies with Wordpress focused in SEO. In the middle of this journey, I founded <a href="http://chocoladesign.com" title="Choco la Design" target="_blank">Choco la Design</a> which have 80k unique visitors/month. It's a collaborative blog about design, where me and my contributors help people in academic research and as a references for they work.</p>

    <p class="about__content">Since 2013 I've focused my research to build web applications which have a better performance, writing a manageable and scalable front-end. This is what I want to keep doing. This is how I believe I can help the web be a better place for the most important client I have in the world: people.</p>

    <p class="about__content"><a href="http://instagram.com/p/forEYuO9z9/" title="Quando me tornei pai" target="_blank">Being a dad</a> made me to become a better professional than I was. This is the reason I get out of bed every morning and think that everything can be possible. This caused me to become more creative in the most critical situations and find different solutions to a single problem. Benjamin is the reason I believe in simplicity.
