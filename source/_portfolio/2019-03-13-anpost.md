As member of the Frontend team at the award winning design agency [Strata3][S3],
I had the privilege to work on the website's rebrand for the main provider of
postal services in the Republic of Ireland [An Post][AP].

My role was mainly focused on develop the new components used on their new
service page, [An Post Money][AM]. The Agile methodology was part of our
workflow with constant deliveries at the end of each sprint.

Over the course of this project a living Design System came to life along with a
Style Guide, as a result of really close work between designers and developers.
