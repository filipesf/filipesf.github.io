I founded Choco la Design in January 2010 with [Willian Matiola][WM]. Since
2014, when Willian left, that Choco la Design is no longer collaborative and has
become my personal blog where I talk about design, development and to share my
professional experiences and opinions.

Over the past 8 years I have been doing content management such as post
scheduling and content curation, as well as managing over 60 people who
contributed with guest posts daily. At the same time, I managed to design and
develop a few versions of the webstie built with Wordpress but now I have moved
to [Jekyll][JK].

Having a personal project for so long has reflected directly in my career and
vice-versa. As a result, in 2018 I had to sync my professional interests with
Choco's by focusing the content on User Interface, User Experience and
Interaction Design, as well as Frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.
