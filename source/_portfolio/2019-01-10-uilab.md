Together with [Willian Matiola][Will] and [Welliton Matiola][Well], we rebuilt
the new UI Lab website. Will and Ton are responsible for the design and user
experience of the website, whereas I developed the core website and new features
on the frontend and backend using Wordpress, their CMS of choice.

The website is the home of [UI Lab][UL]'s online courses, as well as the place
where they can do pre-releases and where the users can purchase UI Lab's
courses.

The website is in constant growth and we're always looking for ways to make it
look and work better. The goal is to deliver a seamless experience and the best
content designers can have.
