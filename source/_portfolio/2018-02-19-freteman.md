I was invited from [UI Lab][UL] to work on the Frontend and Interaction Design
for one of their clients, Freteman, which is a freight service company that
collects and delivers customer's packages.

The project was developed using [React][RJS] in order to make it easy to
integrate with the client's backend platform using RESTful API.
