title: My process
---

I have been working with design and development since 2005 and I was able to go
from **Information Architecture**, to **Visual Design** and **Frontend
Development**, specialising myself in **User Interface** and **Interaction
Design**. This broad technical background has giving me a sharp look at finding
the right tools for building user-centered digital products.

Over the the course of my career I developed my own design process. I splitted
it in four steps: [Discover][D], [Structure][S], [Build][B] and [Refine][R].
However, this is not a linear process; things can happpen randomly or even
backwards as the project moves along. At the end of the day, the goal is to
reach the desired outcome for the project.

[D]: #Discover "Go to the 'Discover' phase"
[S]: #Structure "Go to the 'Structure' phase"
[B]: #Build "Go to the 'Build' phase"
[R]: #Refine "Go to the 'Refine' phase"
