  information from all over the place is challenging, that said it's when we

In other words, the discovery phase is a deep learning process that we can break
it down into:

- **Get to know the people:** Who is involved in the project? What are their
  roles?
- **Get to know the product:** Why and what does it do? What does it look like?
- **Map the journey:** What is current flow of people? How do they go through
  services, products or website?
- **Find out the pain points:** What are the problematic or difficult parts of
  the current solution?
- **Identify motivators:** How do we give the user that shot of dopamine to keep
  them interested?
