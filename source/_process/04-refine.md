title: Refine
subtitle: "Refinement is not an actual phase, but rather a constant that happens
  intrinsically as I go through each step of my design process."

While the discovery, structure and buildindg processes are happening the we not
even notice how much knowledge about the project we have, which means that we
spent less and less time learning and more time doing.

So, essetially, the refinement is always happening. Whether building a brand new
product, doing a redesign or even just implementing a new feature. What I love
the most about refinement is that, we always carry that knowledge with us.
