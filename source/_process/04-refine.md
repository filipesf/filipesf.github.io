title: Refine
subtitle: "Refinement is not an actual phase, but rather a constant that happens
  intrinsically as I go through each step of my design process."

While the discovery, structure and building processes are happening the we
donâ€™t even notice how much knowledge about the project we have, which means that
we spent less and less time learning and more time doing.

So, essentially, the refinement is always happening. Whether building a brand
new product, doing a redesign or even just implementing a new feature. What I
love the most about refinement is that, we always carry that knowledge with us.
