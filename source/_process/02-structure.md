  all together and define the project's structure."

We will now synthesise, sort and organise all the information we have in order
to shape the outcome that we are looking for. By doing that we will have a
better understanding about major parts of the content and itâ€™s structure. As
part of this phase, I generally include:

- **Data analysis:** What data do we have? What data do we need?
- **Define personas:** Who are the users/customers? What are their needs?
- **Get technical requirements:** What are the constraints? What tools and techs
  do we need?
- **Define use cases:** What actions are expected? What goals are supposed to be
  achieved?
- **Write user stories:** How do we describe the user perspective? What features
  need to be added?
